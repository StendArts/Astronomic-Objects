# Astronomic-Objects
This Python module simulates astronomical systems, including celestial bodies and their interactions. It provides classes for celestial bodies and systems, and functions for simulating gravitational interactions, thermal radiation, and orbital dynamics.

The Astronomic_objects.py module is designed to simulate the behavior of astronomical systems, including celestial bodies and their interactions. The code provides a set of classes and functions to model the physical properties and dynamics of stars, planets, moons, and other celestial objects.

The module's primary purpose is to enable the creation of simulations that can be used to study the behavior of complex astronomical systems, such as planetary orbits, stellar evolution, and gravitational interactions. The code is written in Python and utilizes popular libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Tqdm to perform numerical computations and visualize the results.

The Astronomic_objects.py module includes the following key features:

Body Class: A class representing a celestial body, with attributes for its name, position, velocity, mass, radius, temperature, albedo, emissivity, and color.
System Class: A class representing an astronomical system, comprising multiple celestial bodies and their interactions.
Simulation Functions: Functions to simulate the evolution of an astronomical system over time, including gravitational interactions, thermal radiation, and orbital dynamics.
Visualization Tools: Functions to visualize the simulation results, including 3D trajectory plots and temperature evolution graphs.
By using the Astronomic_objects.py module, users can create custom simulations to explore various astronomical phenomena, such as:

Planetary orbits and stability
Stellar evolution and life cycles
Gravitational interactions and collisions
Climate modeling and thermal radiation
The module is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to add new features and customize the simulations to suit their specific research needs.
